TODO List - Flaws, Bugs, Features and Tasks, oh my!

Unresolved
----------

- FLAW: Exceptions are non-repeatable, and they must be constantly managed
  by the employees and managers. Technically exceptions should not have
  years, if they do, we should have a flag for "Once" or "Repeat" so that
  when the exception passes, we create a new one.
  > We concidered this flaw a minor issue. Nov 10th, 2008

- FLAW: We should be taking the Salon business hours and storing them into a new schedule table
  that stores only the hours of operations for any given day. We should use this table instead
  to load business hours in all places in the code. If business hour data is not available in
  the DB, we should create a new entry on-the-fly that uses the salon business hours. This
  makes sure that we store salon hours for all days, and makes sure changing  business hours
  after entering data does not change the rendering of previously set days. If we do this though
  we will then have to allow a way to change business hours for previous days (this requires
  a new interface somehow to change hours of operation for 1 business day).
  > This flaw has been concidered as high priority as this is a negative aspect of the schedule
    information that could cause serious problems in rendering each day. Nov 10th, 2008
  > Philippe resolved this issue by providing a new bean ScheduleHoursBean and mechanisms
    to store the business hours based on salon defaults when schedule entries are created. Nov 10th, 2008
  > Found that this flaw extended to the available hours for employees as well. Nov 11th, 2008

- FEATURE: The manager should have a quick way to book a schedule day quickly based on
  the employee availability records.
  > This feature would certainly be useful, however is lower priority at this point. Nov 10th, 2008

- FEATURE: Search and Delete Sale need to work.
  > This must work. Nov 10th, 2008

- FEATURE: Make the preferences dialog actually work to set availability and password update.
  > This must work for user session control and scheduling limits for employees.

- FEATURE: Finish any alerts that we need to create for the user throughout the app.
  > Non essential at this point. We have inventory alerts, and more could be created
    but there are time constraints. Nov 10th, 2008

- FEATURE: Make sure alerts can be deleted one by one, or all at once (or by type?)
  > Must have this available to managers. Nov 10th, 2008

- FEATURE: Add a legend for cell types in the scheduler and calendar views.
  > This is necessary for good user friendliness. Single images can be made. Nov 10th, 2008

- FEATURE: Add a tooltip on cells to show the date/start/end time (if possible).
  > This feature is non-essential and will make it in if we have time. Nov 10th, 2008

- FEATURE: User HELP icon that opens seperate page for help in all screens/dialogs.
  > This is for user friendliness. Nov 10th, 2008

- BUG: Do not let scheduler or appointment drag cells outside of bounds (dissapear on drop).

- BUG: Only show alert for 1 record type, always keep latest. Show date column in alert list too.

- BUG: Make sure that all search result cells are top aligned, and use nowrap and have
  proper result images.

- BUG: Input checking in all Dialogs must highlight fields RED when finishing.

- BUG: Delete button in appointment dialog needs to be hidden when creating new entry.

- BUG: Start Time/End Time do not render in the Employee scheduler dialog.

- BUG: Dialog boxes need to have input fields cleared if used twice or more.

- BUG: Make errors in appointment creation/edit dialog more obvious.

- BUG: Do not allow anyone to create an appointment if no services are selected.

- BUG: Dialog repositioning and sizing must be fixed for all dialogs, its horrible
  right now.

- BUG: Add the duration Hour+Minute Combo boxes for Services search, maintain and create pages.

- BUG: Fix blackout so that it uses the document height/width, not the browser viewing area, also, make
  blackout everytime we show a popup, do not use the same blackout each time.

- BUG: Pages are not protected by the TAG that is supposed to validate employees.

- TASK: Fill product and services database with basic salon data! (we need lots of producs and
  services that MOST salons would have. We could also make the starter wizard let the people
  pick what product brands they carrie, and we insert only that data.

- TASK: Complete server and client side checking, especially for numerical values. (dont allow alpha in number box)

- TASK: Create a wizard application for installation that will also allow the installer to
  set the basic Salon information to be inserted into the database before people start to log in.

- TASK: Make sure we are using the proper search parameters for all search screens and dialogs.

- TASK: Make sure all pages have proper TITLE, Navigation Position, Menu entry.

- TASK: Check ALL Links on the page for dead links.

- TASK: JavaDoc everything and document javascript to some degree.
  > Philippe has gone over all hs.objects.* classes, cleaned up javadoc and formatting.

- TASK: Check all file headers.
  > Philippe checked all file headers in hs.objects.* classes.

- TASK: Clean up any unwanted code, and WTFs or others...
  > Philippe cleaned up all unwanted code from hs.objects.* classes.


Resolved
--------

- FLAW (RESOLVED): Enforce Limit of Hair Stations (when creating schedule entries) we cannot
  allow booking of more stylists than we can fit into the salon. Do we really
  need beauty stations? We have no way to tell the difference between hair
  and beauty stations right now, so we should just have Stations period.
  > Philippe fixed by removing the concept of hair stations and beauty stations. This limit
    would only provide some probably non-essential control to running a business. Most
    managers would be able to make sure they do not schedule too many people for their
    salon capacity. Nov 10th, 2008

- FLAW (RESOLVED): We totally forgot to use Employee Availability in the scheduler. It should be displaying
  something like we use in the appointment schedule (unavailable time). But instead this would be
  for the staff scheduler, so that the manager does not book outside of the available time.
  > This flaw has been concidered as absolutely necessary. Joey will work on this. Nov 10th, 2008
  > Joey and Philippe fixed this flaw, Nov 11th 2008

- BUG (RESOLVED): Employees can move schedule entries around, only Managers should be able to.
  > Joey fixed this bug Nov 10th, 2008

- BUG (RESOLVED): Fix all the form pages from taking ENTER keystroke to "SAVE" records.
  > Joey fixed this bug on Nov 10th, 2008

- BUG (RESOLVED): Remove comparator from all the beans.
  > Philippe cleaned all that up and used Comparable instead. Nov 10th, 2008
