TODO List
---------

Updated: Sunday, Nov 10th, 2008

- Search and Delete Sale need to work.

- Delete button in appointment dialog needs to be hidden when creating new entry.

- BIG FLAW: We should be taking the Salon business hours and storing them into a new schedule table
  that stores only the hours of operations for any given day. We should use this table instead
  to load business hours in all places in the code. If business hour data is not available in
  the DB, we should create a new entry on-the-fly that uses the salon business hours. This
  makes sure that we store salon hours for all days, and makes sure changing  business hours
  after entering data does not change the rendering of previously set days. If we do this though
  we will then have to allow a way to change business hours for previous days (this requires
  a new interface somehow to change hours of operation for 1 business day).

- Make the preferences dialog actually work to set availability and password update.

- Finish any alerts that we need to create for the user throughout the app.

- Make sure alerts can be deleted one by one, or all at once (or by type?)

- Fix all the form pages from taking ENTER keystroke to "SAVE" records.

- Add Start Time/End Time to the Employee scheduler dialog.

- Dialog boxes need to have input fields cleared if used twice or more.

- Make errors in appointment creation/edit dialog more obvious.

- Do not allow anyone to create an appointment if no services are selected.

- Dialog repositioning and sizing must be fixed for all dialogs, its horrible
  right now.

- Add the duration Hour+Minute Combo boxes for Services search, maintain and create pages.

- Add a legend for cell types in the scheduler and calendar views.

- Add a tooltip on cells to show the date/start/end time (if possible).

- Remove comparator from all the beans.

- JavaDoc everything and document javascript to some degree.

- Check all file headers.

- Clean up any unwanted code, and WTFs or others...
