Unresolved
----------

! BUG: Search sale need to work. It currently returns no results.
  > We need to have this working, its going to be needed. Nov 10th, 2008
  > Thinking of making sales search work in the same way as all other record types. Nov 13th, 2008

! BUG: Salon is not saving.

! BUG: When someone is changing Salon Hours or Employee Hours, we should never allow them
  to edit them outside the limits based on existing scheduled data.

! BUG: Only show alert for 1 record type, always keep latest. Show date column in alert list too.

- BUG: Input checking in all Dialogs must highlight fields RED when finishing.

! BUG: Start Time/End Time do not render in the Employee scheduler dialog.

! BUG: Make errors in appointment creation/edit dialog more obvious.

! BUG: Do not allow anyone to create an appointment if no services are selected.

! BUG: Dialog repositioning and sizing must be fixed for all dialogs, its horrible
  right now.

! BUG: Make sure alerts can be deleted one by one, or all at once (or by type?)
  > Must have this available to managers. Nov 10th, 2008

- BUG: Appointment view does not refresh. Nov 14th, 2008

- FEATURE: Cells need to highlight blue when selected.

- FEATURE: Add a tooltip on cells to show the date/start/end time (if possible).
  > This feature is non-essential and will make it in if we have time. Nov 10th, 2008

! FEATURE: User HELP icon that opens seperate page for help in all screens/dialogs.
  > This is for user friendliness. Nov 10th, 2008

- TASK: Servlets are unprotected from non-authorizes calls, if we have time we need
  to also get this done like the tag does.

- TASK: Fill product and services database with basic salon data! (we need lots of producs and
  services that MOST salons would have. We could also make the starter wizard let the people
  pick what product brands they carrie, and we insert only that data.

- TASK: Create a wizard application for installation that will also allow the installer to
  set the basic Salon information to be inserted into the database before people start to log in.
  > I think it would be a LOT easier to detect the salon record on the first user login, and this will
    allow the first user to setup their account, and salon details to start the app off. Nov 12th, 2008
  > Philippe created the First Time Setup page that we will use as part 2 of the setup procedure. Nov 13th, 2008

- TASK: Make sure all pages have proper TITLE, Navigation Position, Menu entry.

- TASK: JavaDoc everything and document javascript to some degree.
  > Philippe has gone over all hs.objects.* classes, cleaned up javadoc and formatting.

- TASK: Check all file headers.
  > Philippe checked all file headers in hs.objects.* classes.

- TASK: Clean up any unwanted code, and WTFs or others...
  > Philippe cleaned up all unwanted code from hs.objects.* classes.

Resolved
--------

- FLAW (RESOLVED): Enforce Limit of Hair Stations (when creating schedule entries) we cannot
  allow booking of more stylists than we can fit into the salon. Do we really
  need beauty stations? We have no way to tell the difference between hair
  and beauty stations right now, so we should just have Stations period.
  > Philippe fixed by removing the concept of hair stations and beauty stations. This limit
    would only provide some probably non-essential control to running a business. Most
    managers would be able to make sure they do not schedule too many people for their
    salon capacity. Nov 10th, 2008

- FLAW (RESOLVED): We totally forgot to use Employee Availability in the scheduler. It should be displaying
  something like we use in the appointment schedule (unavailable time). But instead this would be
  for the staff scheduler, so that the manager does not book outside of the available time.
  > This flaw has been concidered as absolutely necessary. Joey will work on this. Nov 10th, 2008
  > Joey and Philippe fixed this flaw, Nov 11th 2008

- FLAW (RESOLVED): We should be taking the Salon business hours and storing them into a new schedule table
  that stores only the hours of operations for any given day. We should use this table instead
  to load business hours in all places in the code. If business hour data is not available in
  the DB, we should create a new entry on-the-fly that uses the salon business hours. This
  makes sure that we store salon hours for all days, and makes sure changing  business hours
  after entering data does not change the rendering of previously set days. If we do this though
  we will then have to allow a way to change business hours for previous days (this requires
  a new interface somehow to change hours of operation for 1 business day).
  > This flaw has been concidered as high priority as this is a negative aspect of the schedule
    information that could cause serious problems in rendering each day. Nov 10th, 2008
  > Philippe resolved this issue by providing a new bean ScheduleHoursBean and mechanisms
    to store the business hours based on salon defaults when schedule entries are created. Nov 10th, 2008
  > Found that this flaw extended to the available hours for employees as well. Nov 11th, 2008
  > Philippe fixed the problem completely by also taking a snapshot of employee hours and storing
    them for future lookups for old or future days.

- FEATURE (RESOLVED): Make the preferences dialog actually work to set availability and password update.
  > This must work for user session control and scheduling limits for employees.
  > Split dialog into change password and change availability. Nov 12th, 2008

! FEATURE (RESOLVED): Add a legend for cell types in the scheduler and calendar views.
  > This is necessary for good user friendliness. Single images can be made. Nov 10th, 2008
  > Philippe completed the legends in calendar and scheduler. Nov 14th, 2008

- BUG (RESOLVED): Employees can move schedule entries around, only Managers should be able to.
  > Joey fixed this bug Nov 10th, 2008

- BUG (RESOLVED): Fix all the form pages from taking ENTER keystroke to "SAVE" records.
  > Joey fixed this bug on Nov 10th, 2008

- BUG (RESOLVED): Remove comparator from all the beans.
  > Philippe cleaned all that up and used Comparable instead. Nov 10th, 2008

- BUG (RESOLVED): Do not let scheduler or appointment drag cells outside of bounds (dissapear on drop).
  > Joey fixed this bug. Nov 11th, 2008

- BUG (RESOLVED): Fix blackout so that it uses the document height/width, not the browser viewing area, also, make
  blackout everytime we show a popup, do not use the same blackout each time.
  > Philippe fixed this issue well enough for our purposes, the blackouts now take the full
    size of he browser window, but it does not resize with the browser. Nov 12th, 2008

- BUG (RESOLVED): The cells in Employee Schedule view turn from Blue to Green after first refresh.
  > Joey fixed this bug. Nov 12th, 2008

- BUG (RESOLVED): Add the duration Hour+Minute Combo boxes for Services maintain and create pages.
  > Philippe resolved this. Nov 12th, 2008

- BUG (RESOLVED): Pages are not protected by the TAG that is supposed to validate employees.
  > Joey fixed this one by adding to all JSPs.

! BUG (RESOLVED): Dialog boxes need to have input fields cleared if used twice or more.
  > Joey resolved these issues. Nov 12th, 2008

! BUG (RESOLVED): Delete button in appointment dialog needs to be hidden when creating new entry.
  > Joey fixed this. Nov 12, 2008

! BUG (RESOLVED): In a one hour availability, if we use 45 minutes in an appointment, then we try
  and add a 15 minute service, it will not allow us.
  > Philippe fixed the bug in the servlet that was causing this. Nov 13th, 2008

! BUG (RESOLVED): When deleting schedule entries, or moving them, we are not even checking if there
  is already booked appointments data for those entries.
  > Philippe and Joey fixed this bug together. Nov 13th, 2008

- TASK (RESOLVED): Complete server and client side checking, especially for numerical values. (dont allow alpha in number box)
  > Philippe resolved this task by adding a decimal/number checker in tools.js. Nov 12th, 2008

- TASK (RESOLVED): Make sure we are using the proper search parameters for all search screens and dialogs.
  > Philippe completed this and removed some in services and products. Nov 12th, 2008


Backburner
----------

- FEATURE: The manager should have a quick way to book a schedule day quickly based on
  the employee availability records.
  > This feature would certainly be useful, however is lower priority at this point. Nov 10th, 2008

- FEATURE: Finish any alerts that we need to create for the user throughout the app.
  > Non essential at this point. We have inventory alerts, and more could be created
    but there are time constraints. Nov 10th, 2008
  > Inventory alerts will be the only ones based on time. Nov 14th, 2008

- FLAW: Exceptions are non-repeatable, and they must be constantly managed
  by the employees and managers. Technically exceptions should not have
  years, if they do, we should have a flag for "Once" or "Repeat" so that
  when the exception passes, we create a new one.
  > We concidered this a minor issue, we do not have time to resolve. Nov 10th, 2008
